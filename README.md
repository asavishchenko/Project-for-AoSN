# Analysis of student behavior patterns when using large-scale public online learning

**Introduction**

Due to COVID-19 online learning became widespread and relevant since in many cases across the globe the universities are obliged to implement off-site study processes that almost always involve online activities. Even though the pandemic seems to be at the endpoint, many institutions and companies are reluctant to return back to fully offline education. The question how did the online mode influence the behaviour of the students within the educational process is not yet clear, however. In the process of learning they may acquire different patterns of studying that are as well defined by their socio-cultural characteristics. Moreover, during online learning, some students may change their role to ‘teacher’ and vice-versa. 

Therefore, the research gap of our project is as follows: many papers introduced SNA to patterns of e-learning, but they often either focus on emergent roles only with additional variables or use SNA as a complementary method. Our research, instead, will use SNA as the core method in defining the general behavioural structures of the student network and in addressing adapted roles of students during the process of solving mathematical problems. That is our research topic: “Analysis of student behavior patterns when using large-scale public online learning”. 

The main aim of the research is thus to as much as possible identify patterns of student behaviour whilst solving mathematical problems using large-scale public online learning Junyi Academy. Additionally, it is important in reaching the goal to typologize students based on their socio-cultural characteristics and behaviour patterns. Moreover, analyze, in accordance with the identified types of students, their models of interaction within the framework of the "teacher-student" model. 

Necessary research steps in achieving the goal after picking the dataset include analysis of literature which can help us to understand the topic in a more general point of view, which is presented below, data preparation  with descriptive statistics networking and final interpretation of the results achieved with the discussion of further research. 

**Literature review**

To start with, it should be mentioned that the most comprehensive literature on online learning and patterns of education using social network analysis is built around the online peer interaction and consequent emergence of student and teachers roles within the learning process. This may lead to a better understanding of student activity and final learning outcome for each learner. For that SNA is one of the appropriate tools along with content analysis and other methods. Below is the literature review on the most revealing studies. 

The starting one is an article by Xuemei Wu et al. (2022) that analyses the interaction patterns of diverse roles among learners that possess varying levels of co-reflection in the online learning community. For that they used around 11 thousands of posts in social networks that were analysed with the help of both Social Network Analysis and Lag Sequence Analysis. SNA was mostly used to identify various roles of learners during online education. One of their findings states that people with higher levels of collaborative reflection had an advantage over various roles while having a dialogue and they are far more engaged in self-rethinking.  

When relating to online learning, some papers often use the combination of methods or introduce a new one consisting of re-interpretation of a few others as in the previous case. For instance, the research by Dowell & Poquet presents a combination of semantic tool - Group Communication Analysis - and SNA. While focusing on the emergent socio cognitive roles of students within the process of interaction, they add the dimension of semantic and temporal discourses as influencing factors of interaction. Their data consisted of peer communication that occured within the online course at Coursera which is quite similar to our approach to the sources of data. In the end, they categorized learners into five groups: Lurkers, Followers, Socially Detached, Influential Actors and Hyper Posters.

The idea of creating the new method appears as well behind an article by Marcos-García et al. where they introduce a new method DESPRO with implications for future on how to improve teaching. The role of SNA here is in the characterization of the roles of learners or participants in the educational process similarly to previous research papers. In general, much research on online education focuses on production of practical inferences that will be beneficial for the organization of online or hybrid learning. 

The example of that would be an article by Jiun-Yu Wu and Mei-Wen Nian (2021). It is devoted to the dynamics of online studying with the help of QOPS from pedagogy and SNA. They used posts, comments and messages from Facebook groups in order to see how the community of learners changed with the application of QOPS and how the roles of students and teachers altered during the process. Finally, authors also indicated what was the relation between student outcome and relational ties and other SNA measures. In result, the factors that most strongly affected the final result of learning are students' outdegree, degree, and closeness centralities. 

Therefore, one might say that certain works define online education from a more concrete theoretical stance as for example the case in the paper by M. Saqr. He used the perspective of Problem Based Learning as a part of technology-enhanced learning to study the interaction of students and trace their positions within the process of sharing information, participating in the communication. SNA in his research played quite a similar role to previously mentioned works - it helped to show the dynamics of interaction and roles the students take and their influences over studying results.  

If one compares those articles above, it is clear that there is a certain pattern of research and data sources within the field of online learning. Much of the time, researchers use either social networks communication or a particular online course as the data sources. Moreover, generally, they rarely use SNA as a single method on account of research goals and research themes. For linguistic and behavioral studies, scientists prefer to combine a few methods together for more viable results and when they need to go beyond the roles and positions. 

**Research Dataset**

The research dataset that was chosen for this project is from Junyi Academy - school of public online learning. It focuses on math students and solving math problems within the course. The overall number of observations within the dataset is 16,217,311, while the number of observed students equals 75728. With the help of random sampling the dataset was cut down to 9841 of observations and 50 students overall and it constitutes less than  0.0001% of all pupils. 

The dataset includes such information as age of the person, level attained within a particular course, the status of the student according to the output from the exercises done, the amount of classes to which the user belongs. Additionally, it presents the data concerning teachers’ assistance: e.g how many teachers help, collaborative learning, when students exchange their position into teacher’s one. Based on the socio-cultural characteristics of the pupils and their behavioral patterns, it will be possible to typologize different kinds of students and with the help of that trace the interaction of the ‘teacher-student’ model.

**Conclusion**

In this project proposal we discussed the research route for the analysis of student behavior during online education in the public courses in the contemporary post-COVID 19 world. This project is supposed to be conducted with the application of Social Network Analysis (SNA). As given by literature review, the usage of SNA within the research on online education and student patterns is very stirring: almost the majority of sources contain SNA as a part of methods. However, the uniqueness of our perspective lies in the fact that we focus only on SNA as a core tool of analysis. We anticipate some weaknesses and strengths of such an approach, for instance, more focus on patterns compared to other works, while providing less flexibility in the interpretation. 

The initial dataset for this research is taken from Junyi Academy and by dint of random sampling it was shortened down to 0.0001% of all cases and prepared for further exploratory and interpretive analysis. It gives information about the personal study characteristics of students such as his or her educational level and data on interaction of students with each other and role they are taking. With that, we would be able to distinguish patterns of student behavior during online education – the question which may facilitate the development of study plans and enhance overall pupils’ performance.
